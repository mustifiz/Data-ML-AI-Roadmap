    "## Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming that allows a class (called a child or subclass) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (called a parent or superclass). This promotes code reusability and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes.\n",

    "Benefits of Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "- Code Reusability: Avoids duplication by reusing existing code.\n",

    "- Maintainability: Simplifies code maintenance by organizing code into hierarchical relationships.\n",
